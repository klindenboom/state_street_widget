#Notes

 - It wasn't apparent if the filter logic should be `account type && transaction type` but that is how I coded it.
 - In the interest of time some Material UI Components were used.
 - I tried to show some directory and component atchitecure even tho it may be a little too granular for this exercice.
 - I can modify my coding style to fit existing team and or project style.

 - Let me know if you have any question or would like to see any additional features -- keith.lindenboom@gmail.com
